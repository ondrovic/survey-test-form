# Supabase RLS Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## ⚠️ **DEPRECATED DOCUMENT** 

This document is no longer relevant. RLS has been **completely disabled** to fix realtime subscriptions and simplify authentication.

## 🔄 **Migration Complete**

**Date**: August 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Solution**: RLS disabled across all tables via migration `20250828000003_disable_all_rls_simplify_auth.sql`

## 📋 **What Changed**

### ❌ **Removed:**
- All RLS policies
- Service role key complexity
- Multiple client instances
- `withElevatedPrivileges()` method
- `withAnonymousAccess()` method

### ✅ **New Security Model:**
- Application-level authentication (admin password + cookies)
- Single Supabase client for all operations
- Simplified database access patterns

## 🔒 **Security**

Security is now maintained through:
1. **Admin Password**: Required to access admin pages
2. **Cookie Authentication**: Manages admin sessions
3. **Network Security**: Supabase's built-in protection

## 📚 **Updated Documentation**

See the complete guide: [`RLS_SIMPLIFICATION.md`](./RLS_SIMPLIFICATION.md)

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

If you're setting up a new database:

```bash
yarn db:reset
```

This will create a clean database with:
- ✅ No RLS policies
- ✅ Working realtime subscriptions  
- ✅ Simplified authentication
- ✅ No console warnings
