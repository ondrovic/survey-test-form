# GitHub Secrets Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up GitHub secrets for secure deployment of the Service Line Survey App.

## üîê Why GitHub Secrets?

GitHub secrets allow you to store sensitive information (like Firebase API keys) securely without exposing them in your code or repository. This is essential for public repositories.

## üìã Environment Setup Strategy

### **Local Development** ‚Üí Use `.env.local`

- Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
- Add your Firebase configuration for local development
- This file should be in `.gitignore` (never committed)
- Used when running `npm run dev` locally

### **Production Deployment** ‚Üí Use GitHub Secrets

- Configure secrets in your GitHub repository settings
- Used by GitHub Actions during deployment
- Secure and encrypted
- Not exposed in the deployed application

**Both use the same Firebase configuration values, but in different environments.**

## üìã Required Secrets

You need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

| Secret Name                         | Description                  | Required | Example                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`             | Firebase API key             | Yes      | `AIzaSyC...`                   |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`         | Firebase auth domain         | Yes      | `your-project.firebaseapp.com` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`          | Firebase project ID          | Yes      | `your-project-id`              |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`      | Firebase storage bucket      | Yes      | `your-project.appspot.com`     |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Firebase messaging sender ID | Yes      | `123456789`                    |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`              | Firebase app ID              | Yes      | `1:123456789:web:abcdef123456` |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`      | Firebase measurement ID      | Optional | `G-XXXXXXXXXX`                 |

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Firebase Configuration

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon) ‚Üí **General**
4. Scroll down to **Your apps** section
5. Click on your web app (or create one if you haven't)
6. Copy the configuration object

Your Firebase config should look like this:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyC...",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdef123456",
  measurementId: "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
};
```

### Step 2: Add Secrets to GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Add each secret one by one:

   **For each secret:**

   - **Name**: Use the exact name from the table above
   - **Value**: Copy the corresponding value from your Firebase config
   - Click **Add secret**

### Step 3: Verify Setup

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Push a change to the main branch
3. Check that the deployment workflow runs successfully
4. Verify that your app is deployed without Firebase connection errors

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Secret not found" errors**

   - Double-check the secret names (they're case-sensitive)
   - Ensure you're adding them as repository secrets, not environment secrets

2. **Firebase connection fails in deployed app**

   - Verify all required secrets are set
   - Check that the values match your Firebase configuration exactly
   - Ensure your Firebase project is properly set up

3. **Build fails with environment variable errors**
   - Make sure all required secrets are added
   - Check the GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages

### Testing Secrets

You can test if your secrets are working by:

1. Making a small change to your code
2. Pushing to the main branch
3. Checking the GitHub Actions build logs
4. Looking for any environment variable errors

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit Firebase keys to your repository**
- **GitHub secrets are encrypted and secure**
- **Secrets are only available during GitHub Actions runs**
- **They are not exposed in the deployed application**

## üìû Need Help?

If you're having trouble setting up GitHub secrets:

1. Check the [GitHub Secrets documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
2. Verify your Firebase configuration is correct
3. Check the troubleshooting section above
4. Create an issue in this repository with specific error messages

**Remember**: Your Firebase configuration is sensitive information. Always use GitHub secrets for public repositories!
