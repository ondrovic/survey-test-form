# Survey Framework Migration

## Overview

The Service Line Survey application has been upgraded from a static survey form to a dynamic survey framework that supports multiple survey types and configurations. This migration provides enhanced flexibility, improved admin capabilities, and better scalability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Dynamic Survey Framework

**Previous**: Single hardcoded survey form with fixed service lines and ratings
**Current**: Flexible framework supporting multiple survey instances with customizable configurations

- **SurveyConfig**: Defines survey structure, fields, and validation rules
- **SurveyInstance**: Runtime instances of surveys with specific configurations
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Forms are rendered based on configuration rather than hardcoded components

### 2. Enhanced Admin Panel

**Previous**: Basic data download functionality
**Current**: Comprehensive admin interface with full survey management

- **Survey Builder**: Drag-and-drop survey creation interface
- **Multi-Select Field Editor**: Bulk editing capabilities for survey fields
- **Rating Scale Manager**: Centralized management of rating scales
- **Data Export**: Excel export with dynamic column generation
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of survey changes

### 3. Improved Architecture

**Previous**: Monolithic component structure
**Current**: Modular architecture with separation of concerns

- **Context Providers**: Centralized state management
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable business logic
- **Component Separation**: Clear separation between admin and survey components
- **Routing**: React Router integration for multi-page navigation

## Technical Improvements

### State Management

- **React Context**: Replaced prop drilling with context providers
- **Custom Hooks**: Extracted complex logic into reusable hooks
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form integration for better form performance

### User Experience

- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading indicators throughout the app
- **Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries and error messaging
- **Toast Notifications**: User-friendly feedback system
- **Responsive Design**: Enhanced mobile and tablet support

### Developer Experience

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the application
- **Component Organization**: Clear folder structure and component hierarchy
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation
- **Testing**: Improved test coverage and testing utilities

## Migration Benefits
