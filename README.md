## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (required for Firebase compatibility)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase account (for data storage)
- Firebase project setup

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/service-line-survey.git
cd service-line-survey
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup (Local Development)

For local development, copy the environment example file and configure your Firebase settings:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**⚠️ Important:** The `.env.local` file is for local development only and should never be committed to the repository.

### 4. Firebase Setup

Follow the detailed setup guide in [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md) to:

1. Create a Firebase project
2. Set up Firestore database
3. Get your Firebase configuration
4. Configure security rules

### 5. GitHub Secrets Setup (Production Deployment)

For secure production deployment, set up the following GitHub secrets in your repository:

**🔒 This is required for production deployment only. Local development uses `.env.local`.**

1. **Go to your repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. **Add the following repository secrets:**

   | Secret Name                         | Description                  | Required |
   | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`             | Firebase API key             | Yes      |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`         | Firebase auth domain         | Yes      |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`          | Firebase project ID          | Yes      |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`      | Firebase storage bucket      | Yes      |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Firebase messaging sender ID | Yes      |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`              | Firebase app ID              | Yes      |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`      | Firebase measurement ID      | Optional |

3. **Get these values from your Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Project Settings → General → Your apps
   - Copy the values from your Firebase configuration object

**Note:** These secrets are used during the GitHub Actions build process and are not exposed in the deployed application.

**📖 Detailed Setup Guide:** See [GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md](./GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

   - The application now properly handles checkbox state management
   - Service line selections are correctly synchronized between local and form state
   - Race conditions in state updates have been resolved

4. **Deployment Issues**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors
   - Verify repository settings and permissions
   - Ensure the main branch is properly configured
   - **GitHub Secrets Missing**: Ensure all Firebase configuration secrets are set in repository settings
