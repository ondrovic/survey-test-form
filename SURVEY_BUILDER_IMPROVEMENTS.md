# Survey Builder Field Editor Improvements

**Note**: This document describes improvements to the legacy survey builder. The current application has been upgraded to use a new survey framework with enhanced drag-and-drop functionality and comprehensive admin features.

## Overview

The Survey Builder field editor has been significantly improved to provide a better user experience, especially when working with surveys that have many fields (50+).

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modal-Based Field Editor

**Problem**: Previously, when selecting a field to edit, users had to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page to edit it. This was fine for one or two items but became problematic with 50+ fields.

**Solution**: Implemented a modal-based field editor that:

- Opens in a centered modal overlay
- Provides a focused editing experience
- Eliminates the need to scroll to find the editor
- Maintains context of the overall survey structure

### 2. Enhanced User Experience

#### Visual Indicators

- Selected fields are highlighted with a blue border and ring effect
- Edit button added to each field for clear action indication
- Hover states and transitions for better interactivity

#### Improved Navigation

- Click on any field to open the modal editor
- Edit button for quick access
- Keyboard shortcut (Escape) to close modal
- Clear visual feedback for selected state

#### Better Organization

- Field editor modal is organized into clear sections:
  - Basic Configuration
  - Field Options (when applicable)
  - Preview
  - Quick Actions

### 3. Enhanced Field Editor Modal

#### Features

- **Real-time Preview**: See how the field will appear to users
- **Quick Actions**: One-click buttons for common operations
- **Better Layout**: Organized sections with clear headings
- **Keyboard Support**: Escape key to close modal
- **Save/Cancel Options**: Clear action buttons

#### Preview Section

- Shows exactly how the field will appear to survey takers
- Updates in real-time as you make changes
- Supports all field types (text, textarea, email, number, radio, multiselect, rating)

#### Quick Actions

- Toggle required status
- Access rating scale manager (for rating fields)
- One-click common operations

### 4. Technical Improvements

#### DRY Principles

- Reused existing Modal component
- Leveraged existing context patterns
- Maintained consistent styling and behavior

#### React Best Practices

- Used React Context for state management
- Implemented proper event handling
- Added keyboard accessibility
- Maintained component separation of concerns

#### State Management

- Added `showFieldEditorModal` to survey builder context
- Proper state updates and cleanup
- Maintained existing field selection logic
